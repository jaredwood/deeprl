This repository is for miscellaneous deep RL testing.

# Deep Reinforcement Learning Sampler

This project consists on many smaller projects that test out various deep RL methods.

Inspiration is drawn from various works such as the Berkeley Deep RL course.

Slight variations are used to avoid Mujoco dependencies. Instead bullet3 is used.

This is a work in progress of course since I do work.

Topics so far:
* Imitation learning.
